# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-using-News-Headlines
# Context:
Opportunities to analyze the general market based on sentiment analysis of news exist plentifully, but there are few opportunities to discover or predict the performance of a specific stock based on relevant headlines. This by-company prediction is more useful to users than general binary classifications of an entire market - but I found in my research that properly labeled data for this use case didn't exist publicly.
Used Bag of Words technique(CountVectorizer) to convert News headlines in vectors.
Used Random Forest Classifier to get the Test accuracy of 0.86%.
